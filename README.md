# Web-Scrappers

Just a few web scrappers coded using requests, Selenium, Beautiful Soup, urllib, csv in python
Only codes are here. I will make seperate repositories for larger, more interesting scrappers

# ---Modules--- 
# Selenium : 
Mainly using this to get page_source for infinite scrolling page

# Requests :
Using this to get content from pages without scroll or other such mechanics

# Beautiful Soup :
Main module used to scrape data from the page

# Urllib :
Used to join the urls to pursue next pages in a webpage

# Csv :
Used to work with csv files in python easily
